Start by reading [Installing plugins](../wpmu-manual/installing-regular-plugins-on-wpmu/) section in our comprehensive [WordPress and WordPress Multisite Manual](https://premium.wpmudev.org/manuals/wpmu-manual-2/) if you are new to WordPress.

2.  Unzip the file into a folder on your hard drive 

3.  Upload **/add-existing-users/** folder to **/wp-content/plugins/** folder on your site 

4.  Login to your admin panel for WordPress Multisite 

5.  Visit **Network Admin -> Plugins** and **Network Activate** the plugin. **That's it! No configuration necessary!**

### To use:

A new menu item called **Add Existing Users** should appear under the **Users** navigation menu in the site admin dashboard. It is designed for quickly adding existing users to a site in batches of up to 15 users. Use [Add New Users plugin](https://premium.wpmudev.org/project/add-new-users) if you want to create and add new users in batches of up to 15 users _Please note:_

*   The users are immediately added to the site and automatically listed as users on the**Users** page.
*   They can only access features in the site’s administration panel based on the role they've been assigned
*   Spam filters, especially strict ones for institutional email addresses, often block the emails that the login details.  If unsure use free webmail accounts such as gmail, hotmail that don’t block these invitation emails.

**To add the existing users, administrators simply enter:**

1.  The email address attached to their existing username
2.  Assign their role - you can find out more about different [levels of access here](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wpmu-manual/introduction-to-super-admin-user/).
3.  Once added they'll be sent an email with their login details -- their password will be blank since they just need to use their existing password
